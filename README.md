# KPMG Virtual Internship Project

## Task 1: Data Quality Assessment

Welcome to the KPMG Virtual Internship Project! In this project, we will be addressing data quality issues and proposing strategies to mitigate them. Task 1 focuses on assessing the quality of the datasets provided by our client, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, and understanding how these issues might impact our future data analysis.

### Problem Statement

**Background:**
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a medium-sized organization specializing in bikes and cycling accessories. They have approached KPMG's Lighthouse & Innovation Team, particularly Tony Smith (Partner), to leverage KPMG's expertise in Analytics, Information & Modeling. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd aims to optimize its marketing strategy through effective data analysis.

**Client's Needs:**
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has a substantial dataset related to its customers and transactions, but they lack the knowledge and tools to analyze it effectively for business growth. The Associate Director emphasized the importance of optimizing the quality of customer datasets for achieving company growth.

**Datasets Provided:**
1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transactions data in the past 3 months

**Task Overview:**
Our task is to evaluate the data quality of these datasets and identify potential issues that may impact our analysis in the next project phases. We will also provide recommendations on how to clean and improve the data.

### Approach

1. **Initial Data Review:**
   - We will start by examining each of the three datasets: Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data.
   - Our goal is to identify data quality issues related to completeness, accuracy, consistency, and relevance.

2. **Data Quality Assessment:**
   - We will employ a data quality framework that includes dimensions such as completeness, accuracy, consistency, and relevance.
   - For each dataset, we will evaluate these dimensions and document any issues we encounter.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Based on the identified data quality issues, we will provide strategies to mitigate them.
   - Recommendations will cover data completeness (e.g., handling missing values), data accuracy (e.g., standardizing date formats), data consistency (e.g., formatting and cleaning), and data relevance (e.g., excluding irrelevant columns).

4. **Documentation:**
   - We will document our findings, including any assumptions made during the assessment and recommendations for further actions.
   
5. **Data Quality Framework:**
   - A Data Quality Framework Table has been provided as a guideline to evaluate the datasets against industry-standard dimensions.

### Resources

To accomplish this task, we will leverage various tools and programming languages, including but not limited to Excel, Google Sheets, Python, R Programming Language, and data analytics tools like Tableau and Power BI.

### Get Started

If you are participating in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Access the provided datasets: Customer Demographic, Customer Addresses, and Transaction data.
3. Begin your data quality assessment based on the Data Quality Framework Table provided.
4. Draft an email to the client (as specified in the task description) highlighting data quality issues and proposed mitigation strategies.
5. Commit your changes to this repository and share your work with your team.

Let's work together to ensure the data is ready for Phase Two of the project and support Sprocket Central Pty Ltd in optimizing their marketing strategy.

Good luck, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance!
